### Hello World! üëÅ‚Äçüó®

Most data are stored in databases and knowing the necessary tools needed to analyze and clean data directly in databases is indispensable. Using T-SQL, the version of SQL used in Microsoft SQL Server, needed for data analysis. See concepts such as dealing with missing data, working with dates, and calculating summary statistics using advanced queries. It is important to develop skills needed to analyze data and provide insights quickly and easily.

#### This repository includes the following steps:

* One of the first steps in data analysis is examining data through aggregations. Clean missing data and categorize data into bins with CASE statements.

* Essential math operations such as rounding numbers, calculating squares and square roots, and counting records.

* Create variables and write while loops to process data. Write complex queries by using derived tables and common table expressions.

* Work with partitions of data and window functions to calculate several summary stats and see how easy it is to create running totals and compute the mode of numeric columns.
